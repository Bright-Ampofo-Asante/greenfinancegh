          <h3>PAYG SOLAR HOME SYSTEMS</h3>
          <p class="story-text">
            PEG Africa was founded in 2013 by Hugh Whalan and Nate Heller. The company began by acquiring Impact Energies and piloting solar home systems (SHS) using licensing, notably from M-KOPA and Tanzanian companies. The focused on rural and peri-urban areas in Ghana, later extended to Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, serving households earning $5–10/day with limited grid access.
            The used the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model to collect their revenue. Small daily payments as low as $0.50/day was collected from beneficiaries over 12–18 months. This helps build equity, making the system affordable compared to upfront costs.
            Over 25,000 systems sold by 2017 (100,000+ users) in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire; expanding to 400,000+ users across three countries by 2019.
            Economically, report shows that the project led to $1,000 savings over 5 years per household. It has also benefited the environment by reducing kerosene-related health issues and fire risk;
            The project also provided more reliable lighting which improves education and mobile charging access.

          <h3>SOLAR PV + BATTERY STORAGE</h3>
          <p class="story-text">
            In 2018, as part of Nigeria’s Energizing Economies Program (EEP) under the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Sabon Gari Market, a bustling hub with 12,000 shops became one of the first large-scale private-sector-driven mini-grids to eliminate diesel generators. 
            It was designed to offer reliable, cleaner, and safer power to SMEs, replacing polluting generators and reducing fire risk.
            The project was developed by Sabon Gari Energy Solutions Ltd (a special purpose vehicle of Resource Energy), later backed by Paris-based NEoT Offgrid Africa alongside other investors.
            The project connected 500 shops in phase 1 and target full connection of 12,000 shops. With employment, 20 positions were filled initially, expected to grow to 200 with full rollout.
            Economically, traders report stable lighting, longer operating hours, and improved working conditions.

          <h3>250 MW PLANT USING BOTH SOLAR AND HYDRO</h3>
          <p class="story-text">
            The Bui Power Authority (BPA), initially focused on hydroelectric power since 2013, received a 2017 mandate to add renewable energy, leading to the creation of a 250 MW solar hybrid alongside the existing 400 MW hydro plant.
            Construction began in October 2019, with the first 50 MW land-based solar PV commissioned in November 2020, and a 5 MW floating solar array later rolled out on the dam reservoir.
            The project was funded mainly through BOOT (Build-Own-Operate-Transfer) via a US $47–48 million investment on Phase 1, led by BPA and Meinergy (China). 
            This project has led to grid resilience, emissions cut, job creation.
            Initial 50 MW solar addition, rising total renewable generation to 450 MW which supports 59,000 households. An estimate of 47,000 tons of CO₂ is avoided annually. 350 jobs created during phase 1; over 300 permanent roles; community programs and livelihoods supported.
